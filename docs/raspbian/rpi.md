## Where to buy?

I always buy mine from [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com), they have tons of other great stuff at great prices. They also make make lots of example code and drivers available for their products.

## Pinouts

Depending on the version of the rpi you have, there are different pinouts for the different versions. A great resource is [Pinout](http://pi.gadgetoid.com/pinout) to figur out what pin is what.

## Lights

The main indicators are the lights on the front corner of the board. These are:

	OK (green): The board is active (blinks off when accessing the SD card)
	PWR (red): The board is successfully powered from USB
	FDX (green): Network is full-duplex
	LNK (green): The network cable is connected (blinks off when transferring data to/from the network)
	10M (yellow): Lit when the board is using a 100Mbps link, not lit when using a 10Mbps
