# Python

You can use `pip` to install and keep python libraries up to date. Unfortunately `pip` is a horrible package manager, but it could be worse ... `apt-get` anyone? Some useful, undocumented commands:

    sudo pip list --outdated
    sudo pip install --upgrade

Why the idiots who run `pip` don't make useful commands like `pip upgrade` or `pip outdated` I don't know. Instead there are duplicate (stupid) commands like `pip freeze` which is the same as `pip list`.
